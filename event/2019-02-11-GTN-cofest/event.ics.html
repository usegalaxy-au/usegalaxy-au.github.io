DESCRIPTION:The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place (<a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org">https://training.galaxyproject.org</a>) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by different tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material">https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material</a>.\n\n<div class="multiple-img">  <img src="/assets/media/gtn_cofests.png" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 20px auto;" alt="GTN cofest logo" /></div>The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Friday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.\n\nThe next one will be on the 21st of February.
