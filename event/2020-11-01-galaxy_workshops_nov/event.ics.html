DESCRIPTION:The Australian BioCommons, Melbourne Bioinformatics and QCIF, in association with Galaxy Australia will be running a series of half day Galaxy Training Workshops in November 2020. The workshops will be held online for Australian researchers.<br />\n\n<style>  th, td {    padding: 10px  }  table tr:nth-child(even) {    background-color: #eee;  }  table tr:nth-child(odd) {    background-color: #fff;  }  table th {    color: white;    background-color: gray;  }</style><table>  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Workshop Title</th>      <th>Date</th>      <th>Time</th>      <th>Details</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Online data analysis for biologists</td>      <td>12 November 2020</td>      <td>2:00pm - 5:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/online-data-analysis-for-biologists-november-2020-tickets-123259172503">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>RNA-seq analysis: from reads to differentially expressed genes</td>      <td>17-18 November 2020</td>      <td>10:00am - 1:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/rna-seq-workshop-from-reads-to-differentially-expressed-genes-eoi-tickets-127421476065">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Hybrid de novo genome assembly – Nanopore &amp; Illumina – online</td>      <td>1 December 2020</td>      <td>10:00am - 1:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/hybrid-de-novo-genome-assembly-nanopore-and-illumina-online-tickets-125568852819">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Online data analysis for biologists</td>      <td>9 December 2020</td>      <td>2:00pm - 5:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/online-data-analysis-for-biologists-december-2020-tickets-123610812267">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br />\n\n<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>A summary and further details can be found at: <a href="https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/training-and-events/">Melbourne Bioinformatics Training and Events</a>\n\n<br />\n\n<strong>Online data analysis for biologists</strong>:\n\nThis interactive beginners’ workshop will provide an introduction to using Galaxy for online data analysis. It is based on our Introduction to Galaxy workshop, now being offered across Australia through the Australian BioCommons.\n\n<br />\n\n<strong>RNA-seq analysis: from reads to differentially expressed genes</strong>\n\nAcross two days attendees can expect to gain an understanding of approaches to, and practical experience in, quality control of short reads, alignment, gene counts, data normalisation, differential expression and visualisation. Places are limited to encourage discussion. Our very experienced RNA-seq and Galaxy trainers will be present to answer all your questions.\n\n<br />\n\n<strong>Hybrid de novo genome assembly – Nanopore &amp; Illumina</strong>\n\nPerforming de novo assembly is easier than ever thanks to advances in long read sequencing and platforms such as Galaxy which enable bioinformatics workflows for non-coders. In this tutorial we will use the web-based analysis platform “Galaxy” to create a high-quality assembly of a Bacillus Subtilis strain. The software tools “Flye” and then “Pilon” will be used to perform the assembly and subsequent error correction to improve the accuracy of assembled contigs. You will learn how to will visualize input read sets and the assemblies produced at each stage and assess the quality of the final assembly.\n\n<br />\n\n<hr />
