DESCRIPTION:The Australian BioCommons and Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF), in association with a network of facilitators from the national Bioinformatics Training Cooperative and Galaxy Australia will be running a series of half day Galaxy Training Workshops on Variant Calling in May 2021. The workshops will be held online for Australian researchers. The deadline for signup applications is <strong>5pm AEST, 12th May 2021.</strong> Details on selection are below. <br />\n\n<style>  th, td {    padding: 10px  }  table tr:nth-child(even) {    background-color: #eee;  }  table tr:nth-child(odd) {    background-color: #fff;  }  table th {    color: white;    background-color: gray;  }</style><table>  <thead>    <tr>      <th>Workshop Title</th>      <th>Date</th>      <th>Time</th>      <th>Details</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>Variant calling in humans, animals and plants with Galaxy</td>      <td>25 May 2021</td>      <td>1:00pm - 5:00pm AEST</td>      <td><a href="https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/variants-polyploid">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Viral variant calling with Galaxy</td>      <td>26 May 2021</td>      <td>1:00pm - 5:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/variants-viruses">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Bacterial varaint calling with Galaxy</td>      <td>1 December 2020</td>      <td>10:00am - 1:00pm AEDT</td>      <td><a href="https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/variants-bacteria">Details and Sign Up</a></td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br />\n\n<strong>Variant calling in humans, animals and plants with Galaxy</strong>:\n\nIn this online workshop we focus on the tools and workflows available for variant calling in polyploid organisms in Galaxy Australia. During the workshop you will get hands-on experience using Freebayes for variant calling and SnpEff and GEMINI for variant annotation. The workshop makes use of data from a case study on diagnosing a genetic disease however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other polyploid organisms and biological questions.\n\n<br />\n\n<strong>Viral variant calling with Galaxy</strong>\n\nDuring the workshop you will get hands-on experience using BWA-MEM for alignment, lofreq for variant calling and SnpEff for annotating variant effects. The workshop makes use of COVID-19 variant calling data however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other viruses and biological questions.\n\n<br />\n\n<strong>Bacterial variant calling with Galaxy</strong>\n\nDuring the workshop you will get hands-on experience using Snippy for genetic variation detection and annotation, and JBrowse to visualise variants. The workshop makes use of data from a case study on antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis however the tools and workflows are equally applicable to other bacteria and biological questions.\n\n<br />\n\nThese workshop are free but participation is subject to application with selection. <strong>Applications close at 5pm AEST Wednesday 12 May 2021.</strong>\n\nYou must be associated with an Australian organisation and provide an appropriate organisational email address for your application to be considered.\n\nApplications will be reviewed by the organising committee and all applicants will be informed of the status of their application (successful, waiting list, unsuccessful) by Friday 14 May 2021. Successful applicants will be provided with a Zoom meeting link closer to the date.\n\n<hr />
